# Threat Dashboard

The Threat Dashboard is a proof-of-concept application designed to monitor and log potential threats on both a Windows and MacOS system using three primary modules:

1. **File Integrity Monitor**: Tracks changes to specified files and detects potential tampering.
2. **Process Monitor**: Analyzes running processes, including inactive launch daemons, and verifies their authenticity.
3. **Network Monitor**: Analyzes DNS replies to identify potentially malicious activity.


This project serves as a foundational tool for threat monitoring and is built with extensibility in mind for future developments like full automation, real-time web hosting, and enhanced threat detection capabilities. Note that testing was done with MacOS Big Sur(11.7.10), and results may vary depending on the operating system versions.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file to store API keys for services like VirusTotal for additional threat analysis.

   - Example:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

2. Ensure the `.env` file is securely stored and not exposed in version control.

### Additional Dependencies

### dnsmasq Setup (For macOS Network Monitoring)

1. Install dnsmasq:
   ```bash
   brew install dnsmasq
   ```
2. Configure your system to use dnsmasq for DNS queries. Update your system DNS settings to point to the local dnsmasq instance.
3. Specify the log directory for dnsmasq in the script configuration.

### npcap Setup (If not using dnsmasq)

In order to monitor the network, the Scapy library requires npcap to be downloaded.
Once installed, ensure that Npcap is running to allow Scapy to capture and send network packets.

### Running the Baseline Script

Before running the main monitoring script, you must establish a baseline for tracking.  Go into the File\_Integrity\_Monitor directory. Run the following command:

```bash
python3 baselines.py files_to_track...
```

This will create a baseline of the specified files, which is critical for the File Integrity Monitor.

---

## Usage

### Command Syntax

Run the main script with the following syntax:

```bash
sudo python3 main.py --smart files_to_track... --dns_log_path path_to_dns_log
```

- `--smart`: Enables smarter file tracking.
- `files_to_track`: List of files or directories to monitor.
- `--dns_log_path`: Path to the directory where dnsmasq or Windows logs DNS queries.

### Running as sudo

Ensure you run the script with elevated privileges to access system-level logs and perform advanced monitoring.

## Features

### File Integrity Monitor

- Tracks changes to any file type (e.g., text files, images, executables) by reading them in binary format.
- Does not rely on timestamps, which can be easily modified.
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement secure storage for the baseline JSON file and logs to prevent tampering.

### Process Monitor

- Analyzes running processes and retrieves launch daemons (including inactive ones).
- Uses Powershell's authentication (Windows) or `codesign` (macOS) to verify the authenticity of executables.
- **Improvements**:
  - Enhance detection criteria to identify suspicious processes beyond threat database checks.

### Network Monitor

- Logs DNS responses that are malicious according to VirusTotal
- Addresses macOS limitations in accessing the DNS cache directly.
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement safer storage for the IP whitelist.
  - Rotate logs automatically using tools like `newsyslog` to manage disk space.

---

## Future Expansion

- **Full Automation**: Extend functionality to include automated responses to detected threats.
- **Persistent Storage Scanner**: Expand directory scanning to identify inactive or dormant threats that might activate later. This provides insights into potential threats beyond those currently active in the system.
- **Real-Time Web Hosting**: Expand beyond dns queries and look at real-time url/ip connections.

## Recommendations

### Log Management

1. When re-running the script, delete old logs from the File Integrity and Process Monitors to avoid confusion.
2. Use `newsyslog` or manually rotate logs for the Network Monitor to prevent excessive disk space usage.
   - Example for dnsmasq log rotation with `newsyslog`:
     ```
     /path/to/dnsmasq.log 640 7 100 * J
     ```

### Security Best Practices

1. Regularly update and review the whitelist for IPs and processes.
2. Use secure storage solutions for baseline files, logs, and configuration files to prevent tampering.

## What main.py Does

- **Threading:** Runs the File Integrity, Process, and Network Monitors, with the Network Monitor being in a background thread to ensure efficient and simultaneous operation.

## Interesting/Extra Benefits

1. **File Integrity Monitor**:
   - Reads files in binary, bypassing unreliable timestamp-based monitoring.
   - Works with any file type, providing flexibility.
2. **Process Monitor**:
   - Analyzes inactive launch daemons, offering insights into potentially malicious processes that may only run periodically.
3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - In my research, macOS doesn't make it easy to directly access or manage the DNS cache, and it doesn't store DNS queries in a log that you can easily access. By using dnsmasq, you gain more control over the DNS queries, allowing you to log and monitor them more easily, which is why it's a good choice for this project.
